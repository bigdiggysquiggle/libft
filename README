This is a quick program I've written designed to test all the mandatory functions for the ft_libft project at 42.
To use simply drop your compiled libft.a into the srcs folder.
It will output information on what tests are being run and the results of those tests.
If it segfaults on you that's an issue with your code, I don't know if there's a way to make it continue running the other tests after a segfault.

In the Makefile I have included the commands 'run' and 'rerun'. 'run' automatically compiles and runs,
'rerun' deletes the previously compiled program before recompiling and running.
I have also the commands 'test' and 'retest' to run my functions and prove they work.

It is far from complete and does need more extensive tests added before I can really properly say it works, however.
